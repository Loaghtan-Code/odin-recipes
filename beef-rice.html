                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil, add the rice, stir well, then cook according to the packet instructions.</li><br>
                    <li>Heat a wok over a high heat until hot. Add half the oil and, when it’s just smoking, add the beef. Sprinkle with cornflour and stir-fry until browned all over. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li><br>
                    <li>Carefully wipe the wok until clean using kitchen paper. Bring to a high heat and add the remaining oil. Once hot, add the red onion and fry for <em>1 to 2 minutes</em>, or until just soft. Add the garlic and ginger and fry for a minute</li><br>
                    <li>Half-fill the kettle and bring to the boil. Add the broccoli, soy and oyster sauce to the wok and mix well. Add the vegetable stock cube with <em>250ml</em> boiling water and bring to the boil, stirring well. Cover with a lid (use kitchen foil if you don't have a suitable pan lid) and cook for <em>2 minutes</em>, or until the broccoli is just tender (you don’t want to lose the bright green colour).</li><br>
                    <li>Stir the cooked beef through the sauce and heat for a minute. Scatter over the chilli and coriander and serve immediately with the drained rice.</li>
