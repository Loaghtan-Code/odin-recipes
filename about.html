        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>A basic HTML website that reproduces cooking recipes.</p>
        <p>This is the first project from the foundations path of The Odin Project. Tasked with creating a website using simple HTML and CSS with initially three recipes, images, links and lists.</p>
        <p>The site was originally using basic HTML, and then was updated - Adding basic CSS and to ensure this works acorss all pages with a single css style sheet. From this, i have used Flexbox to then try an make the site look alot cleaner - Keeping a link to what the site looked like previously</p>
        <p>The site only works on dekstop using what little has been learnt from the Flexbox portion of the foundation path on the Odin project so far. More can be read about the Odin project <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
