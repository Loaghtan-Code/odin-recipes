        <li>4 tbsp ready-made tikka masala curry paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp natural yoghurt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>8 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3cm of fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>half tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 and half tsp cayenne pepper (depending on how hot you like it)</li>
        <li>half a 400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>150ml chicken stock or water</li>
        <li>1 and half tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>half lemon, juice only</li>
        <li>half tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Once the ingredients have been prepared, complete the first point below so the chicken can <em>marinate</em> overnight.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and mix with the tandoori paste and yoghurt. Marinate in a non-metallic dish in the fridge for at least a couple of hours (or overnight), stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil or ghee in a deep frying pan, and when it's very hot add the cinnamon, cardamom pods and onion. Fry for 5–6 minutes, or until beginning to brown, then add the ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, turmeric and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>
            After the spices have cooked for about a minute, add the chicken with the marinade. Fry for 3–4 minutes, then add the tomatoes, chicken stock or water, garam masala, lemon juice and salt. Bring the curry to a simmer and cook on a low heat for about 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve the chicken tikka masala straight away with rice or naan bread.</li>
