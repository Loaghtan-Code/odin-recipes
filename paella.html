                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in a deep frying pan over a high heat. Brown the chicken all over – don’t cook completely. Once browned, transfer to a plate.</li><br>
                    <li>Reduce the heat to low, add the onions and cook slowly until softened, about <em>10 mins</em>. Add the garlic, stir for <em>1 min</em>, then toss in the chorizo and fry until it releases its oils.</li><br>
                    <li>Stir in the spices, then tip in the rice. Stir to coat the rice in the oils and spices for about <em>2 mins</em>, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, return the chicken to the pan and simmer for about <em>20 mins</em>, stirring occasionally.</li><br>
                    <li>Add the peas to the pan and simmer for a further <em>5 mins</em> until the rice is cooked and the chicken is tender. Season well and serve with the lemon and parsley.</li><br>
